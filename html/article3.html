                    Proptech is here and it wants your greatest attention. Property investment is not only the hottest money making sector, but
                    so is the smart computer technology behind it in 2017. Innovation has led to online letting agents, property
                    platforms, digital mortgage brokers, AI-powered AVMs, crowd funding for home buying, to name but a few,
                    and it’s all taking the property sector by storm. So what makes all the above possible? Accessible technology,
                    Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, user-centric design, and a flow of innovators.
                    Proptech start-ups are implementing new technology in otherwise very traditional industry to enhance
                    the consumer experience in a way that traditional players have never thought was possible. Whether the
                    technology is provided directly to consumers or as a service to third parties in the market – the niche
                    is there, and it’s likely to only grow in the future.

                    What is proptech? Let’s become familiar.

                    <p> Proptech is the new buzzword emerging in the technology scene, which is basically a nickname for property
                        technology. There are a flood of start-ups emerging that are improving, refining and reinventing
                        the property industry through the use of advanced technology for services such as renting, buying,
                        building, selling and managing residential and commercial real estate.</p>
                    <p> Although proptech may strike some as new, it’s been around for almost two decades. One of the earliest
                        disrupters that introduced property technology in the UK was Rightmove, who made its mark in the
                        real estate tech scene nearly 15 years ago! It may have held the reigns with almost no competitors
                        for years along with Zoopla, but now more players are entering the market realising the urgent need
                        to improve a number of outdated real estate models. </p>
                    <p> Are the big proptech companies feeling the competition? It may be so after reading this list of property
                        technology start-ups. Let’s just say that proptech is big business.</p>
                    <p> According to James Dearsley, the investment outlook for Proptech in 2017 is looking very optimistic indeed.
                        He sited a report published in collaboration with RICS that: </p>
